                    <h3><u>Background</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        It all started with a lucid dream Kase Fenley had when he was 22 years old that changed
                        everything. He had been trekking his way up to the peak of a mountain when, just as he reached
                        the summit, a
                        bolt of purple lightning struck the clouds above. He was vividly aware that something was off.
                        Suddenly, there was a loud blast, and the entire scene turned completely white. The next thing
                        he knew, he was listening to music that seemed so familiar that it was as if it had always been
                        playing in the background of his life this entire time. As it continued to increase, a montage
                        of
                        memories that he had entirely forgotten harmonized with the sound, creating a profound intimate
                        symphony
                        and he said to himself, "it felt like I was graduating life." He came to the conclusion that he
                        must
                        be passing on and all of a sudden awakened filled with love. "I rolled out of bed sobbing. It
                        felt
                        like I had reestablished the connection with my soul. A renewed will to live. From that moment
                        on I
                        was completely transformed left with the question: <strong>How do I create an experience like
                        this
                        for others? How do I restore meaning to people's lives by reconnecting them within?"</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3><u>Problem</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        The fashion industry is completely antiquated from the way it designs, sells, and manufacturers.
                        In
                        general, it hasn't evolved in over 220 years since the opening of the first fashion boutique in
                        St. James Mall, London.
                    </p>
                    <h4>But our solution extends beyond apparel.</h4>
                    <p>The magnitude of the problem we are tackling is evident because it can be understood between all
                        of us, everyone can feel it today or relate to it at some point in their life: loss of self.
                    </p>
                    <p>But just how far has our generation been knocked out of homeostatic balance?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>8/10 people who visit a medical facility do so because of their mind</li>
                        <li>Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 18-34 year olds</li>
                        <li>1 and 3 say their mental health is worse than this time last year</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="text-center my-5">
                        <img class="img-fluid smb-3" alt="eventLogo" src="./assets/img/Picture1.png">
                        <figcaption><em>Despite more therapists per capita than any other time in human history, mental health and addiction issues continue to worsen</em></figcaption>
                    </div>
                    <p>Prosperous societies are facing a significant cognitive decline across the board mainly for 3
                        reasons: our interpersonal networks are deteriorating, our connection to spirituality / religion
                        is in a state of decline, and our connection to nature is being replaced by digital
                        environments. It was Carl Yung, renowned psychologist who pioneered much of modern psychology
                        who said "The greatest threat to civilization lies not with the forces of nature, nor with any
                        physical disease, but with our own inability to deal with the forces of our own psyche."
                        Youthful generations are particularly vulnerable. Many are existentially frustrated, devoid of
                        meaning, which prosperous societies suffer the most from this problem. We don't have an
                        effective tool that is curbing this problem because there's not a single app, feature, or
                        product that will successfully do it. A problem of this magnitude calls for a unique type of
                        solution. A fundamentally human driven one.

                    <h3><u>Solution</u></h3>
                    <p>If we want to transform society from the bottom up, how do we get there?</p>
                    <p><strong>Phase 1</strong> - Use Phenotype's Positioning to excite a larger movement that extends
                        beyond apparel
                    </p>
                    <p>The need for a compelling movement for younger generations that isn't centered around self
                        indulgence, is drastic. Fashion is a cultural medium where movements start. Think of Knight's
                        and Tribes, fashion is anthropologically tied to unify us and the timing is perfect. The
                        importance of unity in the face of adversity right now is felt amongst many with growing
                        concerns of a prosperous future and division is prevalent. The genuine desire to be a part of
                        something meaningful might just be the single most demanded thing amongst 18-34 years olds.

                    <p><strong>Phase 2 -</strong> Launch Phenotyping to risk mitigate Phenotype Workshops</p>
                    <p>The founder (Kase Fenley) has chosen to combine his knowledge of neuroscience and fashion into a
                        single solution that not only ties individuals to the design process, they become the pinnacle
                        of
                        it. He has worked with neuroscientists and engineers around the world to develop and design this
                        breakthrough new technology, we call it Phenotyping. Phenotyping is a 30-minute immersive
                        retail
                        experience in which the client is guided through a series of neuroscientific processes to
                        reflect on
                        what they love in life. From that, our proprietary software creates a design, a momento in real
                        time, using their emotional brain activity.

                        a society to a representation of your spirit. An in depth explanation of the four phases of the

                        The platform that we've developed isn't only revolutionary and the first of its kind. It's an
                        entirely new market opportunity that we fully intend to monopolize altogether. Phenotype will be
                        the
                        first commercial entity to commercially integrate with the brain and create services for it. Our
                        personalized model of design directly challenges the standardized and uniform nature of mass
                        manufacturing, where products are often produced in large quantities with limited variation and
                        uniqueness. The reason why Phenotyping will be so successful and has received so much
                        interaction
                        thus far is because it is extremely novel, exciting, and hands on. Most adjacent positioned
                        companies cannot hold a candle to this new design method because they are too encumbered by the
                        antiquated ways of mass manufacturing. The next 220 years will not follow the same path that
                        previous companies did. Now is the time to adapt for the next 220 years, the next phase of human
                        expression. Where we reinject meaning back into the objects we surround ourselves with. Now is
                        the
                        time to craft around you; to create timeless, meaningful, representation of self. The new
                        frontier
                        is a system that completely transforms how a brand designs, sells, and engages with their
                        customers
                        and Phenotyping achieves just that.

                        Retail stores haven't changed since the 1920s. If you take a picture of the first retail store
                        in the mall of St James and a picture of one today they are virtually the same. Luxury fashion
                        has failed to adapt an innovative environment to compete with online giants because it's wildly
                        divorced from the nuts and bolts of innovation. Today, there is a huge opportunity for
                        prospective investors to transform the retail industry as it once had on that street in St.
                        James Mall that will be felt for centuries. How so?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By focusing on experience, but not only that, Phenotype's answer is to radically change inner
                        cities and the wellbeing of the people within them by reconnecting them to life.

                        Phenotype Workshops are an immersive retail entertainment experience where we connect to nature,
                        each other, and within. The inspiration for our Workshop's comes from the experience one would
                        have at an ayurvedic spa in the mountains or a meditative retreat in the maldives. The problems
                        with these experiences is that they are typically inaccessible in cities. We're building a
                        global retail chain of workshops to foster life in every city. You can think of a Phenotype
                        Workshop as a watering hole in the desert. People will leave here with a renewed excitement for
                        life. Our first concept is currently being designed by leading architects who worked for Kanye.
                        If Build A Bear Workshop is a hybrid between a toy store and Disneyland for kids. Phenotype
                        Workshops are a hybrid between a neuroscience laboratory and a fashion house for adults. They're
                        more akin to a sanctuary than a commercial retail experience. Where you walk out from the
                        experience, full of life, instead of just a shopping bag. The demand for an experience like this
                        in a city where people can retreat is off the charts.

                        What makes the experience so memorable and exhilarating is the phenotyping process and the
                        technology we've developed where you can see your brain create and effect things in real time.
                        The emotional connection-building process at Phenotype's Workshop is a key aspect of what will
                        make it so sought after. The act of creating something with your mind becomes a memorable event
                        completely contrasting the stagnant, predictable, experience that we expect from all fashion
                        retailers today! When you visit a Phenotype Workshop your experience follows four phases and can
